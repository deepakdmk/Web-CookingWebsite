            and patty. Using brioche buns, as opposed to normal burger buns, will give a sweet edge and a well-structured bun that can hold the burger. Toasting the buns on the cut sides adds flavour as well as stability, preventing it from collapsing
            when all the burger juices soak in. </p>
