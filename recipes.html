    <h2><ins>Ingredients</ins></h2>

    <p>
    To make a chicken burger we will need many ingredients.
    
    <ul type="disc">
        <li><strong>brioche burger buns</strong> 4, halved</li>
            <li><strong>unsalted butter</strong> 2 tbsp, melted</li>
            <li><strong>minced beef (15% fat)</strong> 600g</li>
            <li><strong>cheese slices</strong> 4</li>
            <li><strong>pickles</strong> (we like Dino’s Famous Chilli Stacker Pickles) 10 slices, cut into pieces</li>
    </ul>

    </p>

    <h2><ins>Preparation</ins></h2>

    <p><img src="images/prep.jpg" align="right"    width="auto" height="auto">
        A mince with a good amount of fat will make all the difference to the flavour of the patty. 
        Look out for steak mince with a fat content of 15%. And if you have a good butcher near, ask for 
        aged beef mince that has been minced with added fat. 
        It will give the deepest, beefiest flavour, while staying tender 
        and juicy.<cite>Getting a non-stick frying pan smoking hot and squashing the 
            burgers into the pan will allow the patties to form charred, crispy edges – 
            this is the fats and proteins on the surface of the meat caramelising.</cite>  It’s best to 
        only <ins>cook two at a time (unless barbecuing)</ins> because overcrowding the pan will lower its 
        temperature, hindering this caramelisation process.  Putting a lid on the pan once the cheese has been 
        added is important. The steam created under the lid will melt the cheese quickly so the burger doesn’t overcook; 
        and it will also help release the <sup>delicious crusty bits off the bottom of the pan </sup>so they join the patties when 
        they are scooped into the buns.   The sauce may have a fairly long list of ingredients but it’s well worth it. 
        The sweet, smoky and sour combo complements and cuts through the richer flavours of the brioche, cheese and patty. 
        Using brioche buns, as opposed to normal burger buns, will give a sweet edge and a well-structured bun that can hold 
        the burger. Toasting the buns on the cut sides adds flavour as well as stability, preventing it from collapsing when all 
        the burger juices soak in.    </p>
